# python-packages
A workshop for the SDSU AI club on Python packages


One of Pythons most useful features is how easy it is to install and manage packages. Packages can be thought of as expansion packs for code. One might install the Pygame package to get some functions for video game development or one might install Numpy for enhanced array functionality.

To install a package, it is often as simple as typing "pip3 install PACKAGE-NAME" into your computer's terminal.

For this workshop, we will demonstrate some basic functionality of these packages:

Built in packages -- these are shipped with Python and can expand basic functionality

Numpy -- for enhanced array operations  --  install with "pip3 install numpy"

Pandas -- for handling data tables -- install with "pip3 install pandas"

Matplotlib -- for creating graphs of data -- install with "pip3 install matplotlib"
